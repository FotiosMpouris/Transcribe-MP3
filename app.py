        **Troubleshooting Detail:** {error_message_for_user}

        Please ensure your OpenAI API Key is configured correctly in your Streamlit Cloud app's Secrets.
        It should be in the format:

        ```toml
        [openai]
        api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        (Ensure the key string itself, "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", doesn't have unexpected leading/trailing spaces unless intended, and starts with "sk-".)

        Current secrets structure detected by the app (or part of it, may not show all nesting if complex):
        ```
        {dict(st.secrets)}
        ```

        **Steps to verify:**
        1. Go to your app settings on Streamlit Community Cloud.
        2. Navigate to the 'Secrets' section.
        3. Carefully check the secret name is `[openai]` and within it, `api_key = "your_actual_key"`.
        4. Ensure your actual key `sk-proj-xxxx` is correctly pasted without extra characters or missing parts.
        5. After saving secrets, Streamlit Cloud should reboot your app. You can also manually reboot it.
